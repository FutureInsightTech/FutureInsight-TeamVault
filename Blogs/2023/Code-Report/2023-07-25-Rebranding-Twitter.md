Today is July 25, and I am reading code report about Twitter's recent logo change. Regrettably, the iconic blue bird logo was replaced this morning with a new logo called "X."

Elon Musk, the owner of Twitter, tweeted on Sunday that the idea behind changing the logo to "X" was to "embody the imperfections in us all that make us unique." He also mentioned that they will gradually bid farewell to the Twitter brand and all bird-related imagery.

By Sunday afternoon, the web address x.com had already started redirecting to what was once Twitter. The domain had been returned to Musk in 2017 after it was relinquished as part of a merger that became PayPal.

This change from bird imagery to an "X" is just one of the sweeping changes that have occurred since Musk bought Twitter for $44 billion last year. In April, Musk had already renamed the company from Twitter Inc. to X Corp.

# Changes in Twitter

It has been widely expected that significant changes would come after Elon Musk acquired Twitter, and now we are witnessing some of those changes. One notable alteration is the introduction of a "DM limit" that restricts the number of daily direct messages unverified users can send. This change is set to take effect this coming Friday. Additionally, Twitter faces competition from Meta's new app, Threads, which was launched earlier this month.


# Twitter vs Threads

Not too long ago, Twitter's code was accidentally published on Github, providing Threads with enough resources to create its own product. However, the true power of META lies in its ability to incorporate features from other applications and integrate them into their products, although sometimes this strategy can backfire.

I have created a chart to help illustrate the dynamic nature of each social media platform.

As shown in the image above, Twitter seems to attract both intelligent and less aesthetically pleasing individuals, whereas Facebook and Reddit are more popular among less attractive and less intelligent users. Instagram and TikTok, on the other hand, are perceived as platforms for attractive but less intelligent people. Threads, however, was intended to bridge the gap between intelligent and attractive individuals, but unfortunately, there aren't enough people who fall into both categories to make this concept successful.

Furthermore, Elon Musk dealt a significant blow to Threads last week by introducing the first revenue sharing mechanism to different accounts. This change had a substantial impact on Threads. Until this point, META had not shared its revenue with anyone in the world. The only thing users received from META was a virtual internet presence, and to earn some cash, they needed to turn to other platforms like OnlyFans, YouTube, and potentially Twitter in the near future.

# Twitter Future

Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino said in a series of posts that the rebrand is the start of a move to push the app in new directions. She is the former head of ad sales for NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News.

"X is the future state of unlimited interactivity — centered in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking — creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities," she wrote. "Powered by AI, X will connect us all in ways we’re just beginning to imagine."

Musk has teased turning Twitter into a bigger app since he bought the platform last year, talking about an "everything app" similar to what WeChat has become in China.

The shifts marks the end of one of the most recognizable brands of the social media boom. The blue Twitter bird had also become a known icon, and one that the company previously valued.

"Our logo is our most recognizable asset," the company said in a branding page that was still live as of Monday morning. "That’s why we’re so protective of it."


# My Perspective

While I don't fully understand Elon Musk's intentions, I can't help but imagine that he is strategizing a complex and significant move for the company, possibly akin to a game of 5D chess. However, the question remains: Is he trying to overhaul Twitter drastically, or are there other underlying reasons for these changes? Perhaps it's related to the technical aspects of Twitter, such as its use of htmx on the site. Only time will reveal Musk's true intentions and thoughts regarding Twitter.


# Conclusion
In conclusion, under Elon Musk's ownership, Twitter has undergone significant changes, including the replacement of the blue bird logo with the letter "X." The shift towards X Corp signifies a strategic move towards embracing imperfections and exploring new possibilities. The introduction of a "DM limit" and competition from Meta's Threads app add to the platform's evolving landscape. As we await Twitter's future direction, Elon Musk's vision for an all-encompassing "everything app" remains a source of curiosity and intrigue.

This is it from Code Report, and I will see you next time. ❤️❤️

The ``tldr`` command is a utility for quickly understanding how to use a particular command by providing simplified and practical examples. The name stands for "too long, didn't read," indicating that it is designed to provide quick and concise summaries of command usage.

When you run the tldr command followed by the name of a command you want to learn about, it will display a short and straightforward set of examples showing how to use the command. This can be helpful for new Linux users who are not familiar with the syntax and options of different commands.

``htop`` is an amazing tool and I use like all the time to check the processes that are running on my system.

``htop`` is an interactive process monitoring command in Linux. It is similar to the top command, but provides more advanced features and a more user-friendly interface. Here are some of the key features of htop:

- Interactive Interface: htop has an interactive interface that allows you to scroll through processes, select processes, and perform actions on them, such as killing or renicing.

## Command 3: Fortune
``fortune`` is a command-line utility in Linux that displays random quotes, jokes, or ``fortunes`` in a terminal window. It is a simple and fun way to display interesting and often humorous messages on your screen.

The ``fortune`` command comes with a collection of text files containing thousands of quotes, proverbs, and jokes. When you run the fortune command, it selects a random quote from one of these files and displays it in the terminal window.

Here are some tips and tricks for using the fortune command:

- Running fortune with no options will display a random fortune.
- You can specify a particular category of fortunes to display by using the -m option followed by the category name. For example, fortune -m literature will display a random quote from the literature category.
- To display a specific fortune file, you can use the -f option followed by the file name. For example, fortune -f wisdom will display a random quote from the wisdom file.
- You can use the cowsay command to display the fortune in a speech bubble above a cow's head. For example, fortune | cowsay will display the fortune in a fun and whimsical way.

If you want to display a random fortune every time you open a terminal window, you can add the fortune command to your shell's startup script (such as .bashrc or .zshrc).
Overall, fortune is a fun and lighthearted command-line utility that can add some humor and inspiration to your day.

## Command 4: trash-cli
``trash-cli`` is a command-line utility in Linux that provides a safer alternative to the rm command for deleting files and directories. Instead of permanently deleting files and directories, trash-cli moves them to the trash, which allows you to recover them later if needed.

Here are some features of trash-cli:

- Move files to trash: You can move files and directories to the ``trash`` using the trash command followed by the file or directory name. For example, ``trash file.txt`` will move the file file.txt to the trash.
- List trashed files: You can list the files that are currently in the trash using the ``trash-list`` command. This command displays the name of each file, the date it was trashed, and the original path.
- Restore trashed files: You can restore a file from the trash using the ``trash-restore`` command followed by the name of the file. This command moves the file back to its original location.
- Empty the trash: You can empty the trash using the ``trash-empty`` command. This permanently deletes all files in the trash, freeing up disk space.

Using trash-cli can help you avoid accidentally deleting important files and directories, and it provides an easy way to recover files that you didn't mean to delete. trash-cli is available on most Linux distributions and can be installed using the package manager.

### Install Process:
Debain or debian bases distributions, enter the following commands in your terminal.
```bash
sudo apt install trash-cli
```

Arch or arch based distributions, enter the following commands in your terminal.
```bash
sudo pacman -S trash-cli
```

## Command 5: tree
The ``tree`` command is a useful command-line utility that displays the contents of a directory in a tree-like format. It is available in Arch Linux and many other Linux distributions and can be installed using the package manager.

Here are some features of the ``tree`` command:

- Display directory contents: Running ``tree`` without any arguments will display the contents of the current directory in a tree-like format.
- Display subdirectories only: You can use the ``-d``option to display only the subdirectories of a directory, without showing the files.
- Limit depth: You can use the ``-L`` option followed by a number to limit the depth of the tree. For example, tree -L 2 will display the contents of the current directory and its immediate subdirectories.
- Show hidden files: You can use the ``-a`` option to display hidden files (files that start with a dot) in the tree.
- Colorize output: You can use the ``-C`` option to colorize the output of tree. This makes it easier to distinguish between different types of files and directories.
- Output to file: You can use the ``-o`` option followed by a filename to save the output of tree to a file instead of displaying it in the terminal.
- Follow symbolic links: You can use the ``-L`` option followed by the word ``follow`` to follow symbolic links and display their targets in the tree.

The ``tree`` command is a powerful and flexible tool for displaying the contents of a directory in a clear and organized way. It can be useful for navigating large and complex directory structures and for finding files and directories that are nested deep within a directory hierarchy.

### Install Process:
Debain or debian bases distributions, enter the following commands in your terminal.
```bash
sudo apt install tree
```

Arch or arch based distributions, enter the following commands in your terminal.
```bash
sudo pacman -S tree
```

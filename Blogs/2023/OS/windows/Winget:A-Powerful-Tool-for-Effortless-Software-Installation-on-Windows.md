For years, when it came to installing applications on Windows, we would visit the internet, like the Google Chrome website, and download the **.exe** file. Once downloaded, we would click and click until the application was installed on our system.

However, this method had its drawbacks. If you had a slow internet connection, it would take time to download all the exe files from the browser, and then you had to go through the clicking process to install each application. But no more! Introducing **Winget**.

# Winget

Winget is a command-line tool developed by Microsoft that allows users to quickly and easily install, update, and manage software packages on Windows 10 and Windows 11 operating systems. It provides a convenient way to discover and install applications from the Microsoft Store as well as third-party repositories.

Winget is designed to simplify the software installation process by using simple commands in the Windows command prompt or PowerShell. It leverages a repository-based model, where software packages are published in a structured format and can be easily accessed and installed using specific commands.

With Winget, users can search for available packages, view package details, install or uninstall software, update installed packages, and manage dependencies. It provides a consistent and streamlined approach to software management, similar to package managers found in other operating systems like Linux.

Winget supports both graphical and command-line interfaces, allowing users to choose their preferred method of interaction. It provides a growing catalog of software packages, including popular applications and developer tools, and also allows developers and organizations to publish their own packages.

Winget is awesome - with just one command, you can install all of your applications at once.

# Installing Winget

Installing Winget is very easy. If you are using Windows 11, Winget is already installed on your system. However, if you are using Windows 10, you might need to install Winget from the Microsoft Store.

To install Winget, follow these steps:

1. Search for "Microsoft Store" in the Windows search bar.

5. Click on "Install". Winget should now be installed on your system.

# Using Winget

Using Winget is easy and can save you time. Here are some basic commands to get you started. If you don't know the name of the software, you can visit [winget.run](https://winget.run/) to search for all software and copy the command to install the application.

## Search

To search for any software using Winget, follow these instructions:

1. Open PowerShell or CMD.
2. Enter the following command to search:

   ```ps
   winget search <package_name>
   ```

   Replace `<package_name>` with the name of the software you're searching for.
   **Example:**

   ```ps
   winget search google-chrome
   ```

## Install

Once you have found your desired application, it's time to install it. To install the application, you need two pieces of information: the Application ID and the Application name. You can find both of these by searching for the application or copying the command from [winget.run](https://winget.run/). The installation command is as follows:

```ps
winget install -e --id <package_name>
```

**Example:**
To install the Unity Hub, the command would be:

```ps
winget install -e --id Unity.UnityHub
```

## Upgrade

Now that you have all the applications installed on your system, it's essential to keep them updated. You can do this by entering the following command:

```ps
winget upgrade --all
```

![upgrade-applications](/images/2023/Operating-System/Windows/Use-winget/upgrade-all.png)

This command will check the version numbers of all your applications and search for any available updates. If updates are found, Winget will download and install them on your system.

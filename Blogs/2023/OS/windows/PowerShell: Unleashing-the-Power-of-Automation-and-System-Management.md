# PowerShell: A Powerful Tool for Windows System Management

PowerShell is a versatile command-line shell and scripting language developed by Microsoft. It is designed to assist IT professionals and system administrators in automating administrative tasks and managing configurations in Windows environments. PowerShell provides access to various system administration objects and APIs, enabling users to interact with and manipulate system components such as the file system, registry, services, processes, and more.

## Key Features of PowerShell

1. **Object-Oriented:** PowerShell treats data as objects rather than plain text, allowing easy manipulation and filtering of output using various cmdlets (commands).

2. **Cmdlets:** PowerShell cmdlets are small, single-function commands that perform specific tasks. They follow a Verb-Noun naming convention (e.g., Get-Process, Set-Item, New-Service), making it easier to understand their functions.

3. **Pipelining:** PowerShell allows you to chain commands together using pipes (|), passing the output of one cmdlet as the input to another. This enables users to perform complex operations by combining simple cmdlets.

4. **Scripting Language:** PowerShell is a full-fledged scripting language with features like variables, loops, conditional statements, functions, and error handling. This makes it ideal for writing automation scripts and managing repetitive tasks.

5. **Integration with .NET:** PowerShell leverages the .NET Framework, enabling users to access a wide range of .NET classes and assemblies for more advanced scripting capabilities.

6. **Remoting:** PowerShell supports remote administration, allowing users to execute commands on remote computers in the network.

7. **Desired State Configuration (DSC):** PowerShell DSC enables administrators to define the desired state of a system or application and ensure that the configurations remain consistent.

PowerShell is not limited to Windows environments. It is also available for cross-platform use, being open-source and available for macOS and various Linux distributions as PowerShell Core. With its rich set of features and capabilities, PowerShell has become an essential tool in the IT world for automation, administration, and management of Windows environments.

## Basic PowerShell Commands

PowerShell offers a wide range of commands to navigate and manage your system efficiently. Here are some essential basic commands to help you get started:

### Get-Command

The Get-Command cmdlet provides an easy-to-use reference of all available commands in your current session. Simply type this command in the PowerShell terminal to view the comprehensive list of commands at your disposal.

![get-command](/images/2023/Operating-System/Windows/PowerShell-Script/get-commands.png)

### Get-Help

The Get-Help command is a crucial tool for anyone using PowerShell. It grants access to the information you need to run and work with all available commands. To use this command, simply type it in the PowerShell terminal.

![get-help](/images/2023/Operating-System/Windows/PowerShell-Script/get-help-command.png)

### Set-ExecutionPolicy

PowerShell restricts scripting by default to prevent malicious scripts from executing in the environment. To run your own scripts, you'll need to enable scripting. The Set-ExecutionPolicy command allows you to control the level of security surrounding PowerShell scripts. You can set four security levels:

- **Restricted:** Default security level that blocks PowerShell scripts from running, allowing only interactive commands.
- **All Signed:** Permits scripts to run only if they are signed by a trustworthy publisher.
- **Remote Signed:** Allows locally-created scripts to run and remotely-created scripts if signed by a reputable publisher.
- **Unrestricted:** Permits all scripts to run by removing all restrictions from the execution policy.

To find out the current execution policy, use the Get-ExecutionPolicy command.

To read more about this command, you can use the Get-Help command or visit the [Microsoft Documentation](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/scripting/table-of-basic-powershell-commands/).

### Get-Service

The Get-Service command retrieves information about the services installed on your computer. It allows you to find out the status of a service, start or stop a service, and even change the properties of a service. To use this command, type it in the PowerShell terminal.

![get-service](/images/2023/Operating-System/Windows/PowerShell-Script/get-service.png)

### Get-EventLog

Use PowerShell to parse your machine’s event logs with the Get-EventLog cmdlet. For example, to view the Application log, use the following command:

```ps
Get-EventLog -Log "Application"
```

You can also use various options with this command for verbose output, error handling, and more.

![get-eventlog](/images/2023/Operating-System/Windows/PowerShell-Script/Get-Event-Log.png)

### Get-Process

The Get-Process command allows you to get a quick list of all the currently running processes. You can also filter processes based on specific criteria. For example, to get all processes with a working set greater than 20 MB, use the following command:

```ps
Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.WorkingSet -gt 20000000}
```

### Stop-Process

Stop-Process is used to terminate processes that are frozen or no longer responding. You can specify the process name or use wildcard characters to stop multiple processes simultaneously. For example:

```ps
Stop-Process -processname notepad
```

### Get-ChildItem

The Get-ChildItem cmdlet retrieves items in one or more specified locations, including files, directories, and other objects. It is a versatile tool for file and directory management. For example:

```ps
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Test
```
#### Examples: Get child items from a file system directory
This example gets the child items from a file system directory. The filenames and subdirectory names are displayed. For empty locations, the command doesn't return any output and returns to the PowerShell prompt.

The ``Get-ChildItem`` cmdlet uses the Path parameter to specify the directory ``C:\Test``. ``Get-ChildItem`` displays the files and directories in the PowerShell console.
```ps
Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Test

Directory: C:\Test

Mode                LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                -------------         ------ ----
d-----        2/15/2019     08:29                Logs
-a----        2/13/2019     08:55             26 anotherfile.txt
-a----        2/12/2019     15:40         118014 Command.txt
-a----         2/1/2019     08:43            183 CreateTestFile.ps1
-ar---        2/12/2019     14:31             27 ReadOnlyFile.txt

```
By default Get-ChildItem lists the mode (Attributes), LastWriteTime, file size (Length), and the Name of the item. The letters in the Mode property can be interpreted as follows:

- l (link)
- d (directory)
- a (archive)
- r (read-only)
- h (hidden)
- s (system)



# Combine Commands with Scripts
PowerShell's true power lies in its ability to combine the simplicity of command-line commands with the flexibility of a full-fledged programming language. It empowers users to streamline their daily tasks, automate time-consuming processes, and unleash their creativity to build sophisticated solutions.

For instance, here are two custom scripts that demonstrate the power of PowerShell:

**1. Sudo Script**

The following script allows users to run a command or script with elevated privileges using Windows Terminal. It simplifies the process of running PowerShell commands with administrative privileges.

```ps
function sudo {
    if ($args.Count -gt 0) {
        $argList = "& '" + $args + "'"
        $wtExe = "wt.exe"
        Start-Process -FilePath $wtExe -ArgumentList "-p", "Windows PowerShell", "-NoExit", "-c", $argList -Verb RunAs
    }
    else {
        $wtExe = "wt.exe"
        Start-Process -FilePath $wtExe -ArgumentList "-p", "Windows PowerShell", "pwsh.exe" -Verb RunAs
    }
}
```

**2. Remove Item Script**

This script is a user-defined PowerShell function that simplifies the process of removing files and folders. It enforces mandatory parameter usage, allows users to pass the path as the first argument without specifying the

 parameter name, and ensures that a valid non-empty path is provided.

```ps
function rm {
    [CmdletBinding()]
    param (
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$true, Position=0)]
        [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
        [string]$Path
    )

    Remove-Item -Path $Path -Recurse -Force
}
```

### App.js File
#### Code Explain
This code represents a Node.js application that sets up an Express server and interacts with the OpenAI API. Here's an explanation of each section:

1. Dependencies: The code requires several dependencies to be installed, including express, path, openai, and dotenv. These dependencies are imported using the require function. dotenv is used to load environment variables from a .env file.
2. Initializing the Express app: The express module is used to create an instance of the Express application.
3. Port: The port variable is set to 1313 or the value of the PORT environment variable. This determines the port on which the server will listen for incoming requests.
4. JSON Parser: The express.json() middleware is used to parse incoming JSON requests.
5. Public Directory: The publicDirectory variable is set to the path of the "public" directory, which will be used to serve static files such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
6. URL-encoded Parser: The express.urlencoded() middleware is used to parse URL-encoded requests.
7. Configure OpenAI: The OpenAI API is configured by creating a new instance of openai.Configuration and providing the organization and API key from the environment variables.
8. Routes: The code defines two routes:
   - The '/' route responds with the index.html file located in the root directory.
   - The '/chat' route handles a POST request, retrieves the message data from the request body, and calls the OpenAI API's createChatCompletion method to generate a response. The response is then sent back as JSON.
9. Server Start: The server is started by calling the app.listen() method, which specifies the port to listen on. A console log is included to indicate that the server is running.

This code sets up a basic Express server that serves static files and provides an API endpoint for interacting with the OpenAI API. It listens for incoming requests on the specified port and handles the /chat route to generate chatbot responses.

#### Code
```javascript
//  Dependencies: express, path, openai, dotenv
const openai = require('openai');
require('dotenv').config();
const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');

// Initializing the express app
const app = express();
// Port 
const port = 1313 || process.env.PORT;

//  Json Parser
app.use(express.json());
// Public Directory
const publicDirectory = path.join(__dirname, "./public");
app.use(express.static(publicDirectory));

app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

//Configure OpenAI
const configuration = new openai.Configuration({
    organization: process.env.OPENAI_ORG,
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
});

const openaiapi = new openai.OpenAIApi(configuration);

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, '/index.html'));
});

  
// Calling the /chat route and passing data to the server
app.post('/chat', async (req, res) => {
    const messages = req.body.messages;
    const model = req.body.model;
    const temp = req.body.temp;

    const completion = await openaiapi.createChatCompletion({
        model: model,
        messages: messages,
        temperature: temp,
    });
    res.status(200).json({ result: completion.data.choices });
});

// Running the server on PORT 1313
app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Pheonix AI is Running on PORT: ${port}`);
});

```
